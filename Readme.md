# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a tic-tac-toe game that I built as part of a course I'm taking to brush up my frontend skills.

## Course Details

The course I am following is called "React - The Complete Guide (incl. Redux)" and is available on Udemy. It covers all the fundamentals of React and includes topics like component-based architecture, state management, and more.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
